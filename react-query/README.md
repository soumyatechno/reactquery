# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

what is React Query ?
=> React Query is a library for fetching data in a React application.

Why we need to use it ?
=> 1. React is a UI libarary si there is no specific rule for data fetching. 2. useState state hook is used to mantain the state such a s loading, error etc and useEffect hook is used for fetching the data.
3.If data is needded to use throughout the app we tend to use state management library for that. 4. Many of the state manangement libraries are used for maintining the client side data not very suitable for serverside data.

What is Client side data ?
=> Clint state is persisted in app memory and accessing or updating the data is synchronous.

What is Server side data ?

=> Persisted remotely and requires asynchronous API to fetch the data.
Has shared ownership.
Data can be updated by someone else without your knowledge.
UI data may not be sync with the remote data.

What we are going to do in this project ?

=> 1.Basic Queries. 2. Poll Data.
3.RQ Dev tools.
4.Create reusable query hooks.
5.Query By ID.
6.Parallel Query. 7. Dynamic Query. 8. Dependent Queries 9. Infinite & Paginated Queries. 10. Updated data using mutation. 11. Invalidate Queries. 12. Optimistic updates. 13. Axios Interceptor.
